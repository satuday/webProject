            <p>The Art of Code is an educational website. But not one in the way you might think. We're committed
                 to building the best learning experience inside and out, making The Art of Code the best place for 
                our team to learn, teach, and create the online learning experience of the future.</p>
         <p>  Education is old. The current public school system in the US dates back to the 19th 
             century and wasn't designed to scale the way it has. Lots of companies are working to "disrupt" 
             education by changing the way things work in the classroom and by bringing the classroom online.</p>

 <p> We're not one of those website. We are rethinking education from the bottom up. 
     The web has rethought nearly everything - commerce, social networking, healthcare, and more. We are 
     building the education the world needs - the first truly net native education. We take more cues 
     from Facebook and Zynga in creating an engaging educational experience than we do from the classroom.</p>

 <p> We do not want to open up universities. We want to open up knowledge. Everyone knows something they can teach someone else and we want to help them do it. </p>

 <p> Education is broken. Come help us build the education the world deserves.</p>
